# COA TASKFORCE TAKE HOME

### This repository is my journey to an interactive photo gallery coding challenge. I built this project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and also worked on two separate javascript coding challenges.

## The Challenge

### The goal was to create an interactive photo gallery that matched the provided Figma designs pixel-perfectly.  It also involved implementing hover interactions and ensuring the gallery worked seamlessly across different devices and browsers.

## What You'll Find Here

### . **Interactive Photo Gallery:** Check out the 'index.html' file and its companion CSS ('styles.css') and JavaScript ('script.js') files to see the photo gallery come to life. I focused on responsiveness, Figma design accuracy, hover interactions, and cross-browser compatibility.
### . **Coding Challenges:** Dive into the 'Challenges' folder to see my solutions for the two JavaScript coding challenges.
#### . 'arrayMap.js:' This file tackles the problem of finding a contiguous subarray that adds up to a specific target sum within a given array.
#### . 'stringTransform.js:' Here, I implemented a function that transforms a string based on its divisibility by 3, 5, or 15.
### . **README (You're Here!):** This file provides an overview of the project, including instructions and how-tos.

## How to Get Started

### 1. Grab the Figma Designs: (Insert instructions on how to access Figma designs - likely a link). These designs were my blueprint for building the gallery.
### 2. Set Up Your Dev Environment: Fire up your favorite code editor (I used [insert your choice here]) and make sure you have the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tools ready to go.
### 3. Clone It! If you want to play around with the code, clone this repository to your local machine.
### 4. Project Structure: I've organized the project with separate folders for code ('index.html', 'styles.css', 'script.js', and the 'Challenges' folder) and any assets (images, fonts).
### 5. Run It! Open 'index.html' in your browser to see the photo gallery in action.
